# FLAPPY BIRD
Flappy bird flew into an endless pipe zone (or is it?) and needs help flying through to get out.  

# ABOUT THE GAME
A simple side-scrolling game where the player controls a bird to fly between pipes without hitting them.  Flying between each set of pipes scores 1 point and hitting them or the ground ends the game.  See how long you can last.

 * JavaScript  game logic

# ASSETS
 * Flappy Bird (Google Images) ??? - TBD

# MVP
- start the game with a 'press button'
— bird falls default to gravity
— bird flies to keydown ‘spacebar’
— pipes spawn top and bottom (rectangles) and scroll to the left
— track score
- end game on collision

# STRETCH GOALS
- animate bird
- add sounds for scoring, flying, and collision
— a customized theme
— game is animated while waiting for player to start game
— night time / day time
- add a running time to display
- make the game web responsive

# ADDITIONAL TECHNOLOGY
